```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

Trying [Distill](https://rstudio.github.io/distill) as a new blogging backend, replacing blogdown/hugo. I don't really need all the customization from blogdown/theme, and don't really want to deal w/ (breaking) changes from hugo. Reference [here](https://themockup.blog/posts/2020-08-01-building-a-blog-with-distill/).

```{r, plot-test}
head(mtcars)
plot(mtcars)

```

Notables so far:

- really like the simplicity...can truly focus on creating posts
- no addin for new post, but I'm guessing there will be one if I look harder
  - new post by create_post()
- seems to need to knit each post before it showing as a post
